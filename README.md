This application is a health app designed to help people start a healthy lifestyle. It can assist users in setting medication reminders, tracking menstrual cycles, encouraging participation in health challenges such as walking, interacting with the community, and more.

Our app can be run using the Expo Go application. To run it, execute the command 'npx expo start' and scan the available QR code.

In this repository, we have also included the Figma file previously created as a prototype for this application.
